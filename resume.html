						<p><b>Research:</b> <i>Kawasaki Disease Research Center, UCSD</i> <span class="right">Aug 2017–Aug 2018</span></p>
						<p>
							Research using the latest developments in Machine Learning (incl SVMs, Boosted Decision Trees, and Deep Neural Networks) to diagnose the rare childhood illness, Kawasaki Disease. Refining my models that already get higher accuracy than any other diagnosis method.

					<div class="textblock">
						<p><b>Internship:</b> <i>Breinify, Inc.</i> <span class="right">May–Aug 2017</span></p>
						<p>
							I implemented a system to retrieve aggregated data of specific individuals from graph databases. I then generated new insights based on this data with inference models, even creating a responsive web platform to visualize my work.

						<p><b>Research:</b> <i>USC Machine Learning Center</i> <span class="right">Aug 2016–May 2018</span></p>
						<p>
							Research into the latest machine learning algorithms to solve challenging problems, especially in computational biology and health care. Worked on improving models that diagnose diseases from symptom information. Also created models to analyze changes in biological neurons while the brain is learning.

					<div class="textblock">
						<p><b>Internship:</b> <i>BioBlocks, Inc.</i> <span class="right">May–Aug 2016</span></p>
						<p>
							I improved the speed/reliability of the BioBlocks database, adding new features—including a system writing procedures in English for Hungarian chemists & a system automating chemical supply/shipping logistics.

						<p>
							It is still not fully understood exactly how neural networks are able to solve the complex tasks that have recently pushed AI research forward. We present a novel method for determining how information is structured inside a neural network. Using ablation (a neuroscience technique for cutting away parts of a brain to determine their function), we approach several neural network architectures from a biological perspective. Through an analysis of this method's results, we examine important similarities between biological and artificial neural networks to search for the implicit knowledge locked away in the network's weights.
